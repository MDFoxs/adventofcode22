## Day 1

### Approach
First question I had was how to open a file. Once I got that done the logic was pretty simple to walk through. I had used most of the functions before in exercism prompts. Although I did need to refresh on a few such as slicing a list. 

### Retro
When discussing my solution with someone they mentioned best practice is to close a file you open. I have not done that before so figuring out where and how to do that would be my next steps.
